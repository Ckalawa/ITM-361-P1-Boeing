    <h3>717</h3>
	<img src="images/717.png" alt="717">
    <p>The 717 was designed to compete with short trip market monopolized by McDonnell Douglas. Currently the remaining 717s are in the proocess of being retired by their major operator Delta. Intrestingly, the 717 has flown for over 20 yearss with only 6 accidents (no casulaties or hull losses, and one of them occured this year back in June when the front landing gear didn't deploy). The 717 has a max capacity of 110 passangers, a max take of weight of 120000 lbs, and a max range of 2400 miles. </p>
    <h3>727</h3>
	<img src="images/727.webp" alt="727">
    <p>One of the first short length aircraft designed by Boeing, the 727 is also the first Boeing airframe to be completely retired. The 727 is also boeings only entry into the tri-engine configuration that was prelavent in the 80s. It was famously the aircraft involved in the D. B. Cooper incident. The 727 was succeed by the 757. The 727 had a max capacity of 130 passangers, a max take off weight of 210000 lbs, and a max range of 3000 miles.</p>
    <h3>737</h3>
	<img src="images/737.gif" alt="737">
    <p>The most popular jet in the world, the 737 is the definition of a workhorse. The face of the SouthWest fleet (one of the largest airlines to only use one aircraft family), the 737 is most likely the airplane that will be flying over you. The 737 like its competitors the A320 has also gone under a next-gen upgrade the MAX family (which has already had a shaky histroy). The 737 has a max capacity of 210 passangers, a max take off weight of 200000 lbs, and a max range of 4500 miles</p>
    <h3>747</h3>
	<img src="images/747.png" alt="747">
    <p>Nicknamed the Queen of the Skies. The 747 was the worlds first jumbojet, and is one of the largest planes in active service behind the C-5 and A380. The 747 is a power symbol often associated with world leaders, being the base model for Air Force One. The 747 has a max capacity of 500 passangers, a max take off weight of 987000 lbs, and a max range of 9000 miles.</p>
    <h3>757</h3>
	<img src="images/757.webp" alt="757">
    <p>The 757 is possibly the most overpowered aircrat in the world. Equipped with 2 rolls Royce turbofans, the 757 was originally designed to operate off small runways and at heigher takeoff altitudes. This jet also has a unique role as Air Force Two, transporting the VP and other cabinet level psoitions, and sometimes the President when the airport is too small for the 747. This jet also happens to be my favorite jetliner. The 757 has a max capacity of 295 passangers, a max take off weight of 124000 lbs, and a max range of 4500 miles.  </p>
    <h3>767</h3>

    <p>Boeings first attemt at a wide body twin-engine jet. The 767 is also the maine airframe for many military use jets from in-air refuelers to telecomunication platforms. The 767 has a max capacity of 250 passangers, a max take off weight of 450000 lbs, and a max range if 7600 miles. </p>
    <h3>777</h3>
	<img src="images/777.png" alt="777">
    <p>One of the safest and smoothest aircraft in the world. The 777 was the gold standard in aircraft design, and instantly became one of the premier aircraft in the industry. Like its sibling, the 777 is also commonly used an international presidential transport. The 777x is the newest passanger airliner in the indusrty, and will also be the longest aircraft in the world. The 777 has a max capacity of 440 passangers, a max take off weight of 805000 lbs, and a max range oof 11000 miles.</p>
    <h3>787</h3>
	<img src="images/787.png" alt="787">
    <p>Dubbed the dreamliner, the 787 is the worlds most advanced civilian airliner. It was made with a single carbon fiber composite frame insread of the usual aluminum shell. The 787 has a max capacity of 330 passangers, a max take off weight of 254000 lbs, and a max range of nearly 9000 miles.</p>
